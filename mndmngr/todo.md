add shell script for installation

- should check for python3, pip3, etc.
- also set the PYTHONPATH here

add makefile?
add .env_example

- remove checks against main (probably put them in tests) - this should happen in script
- add tests
- set up context manager for directory changes

- devrequirements.txt?
